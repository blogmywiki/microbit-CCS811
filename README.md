# microbit-CCS811

An adaptation of https://github.com/Notthemarsian/CCS811 to allow you to connect a CCS811 indoor air quality sensor to the BBC micro:bit to print eCO2 and TVOC (total volatile organic compound) readings to a serial console over USB.

I've also added a version that is a self-contained air quality sensor with an OLED display.
